[Demo Site](https://personal-wardrobe-fe.herokuapp.com)

## What project is? Why I made it?
I created Personal Wardrobe application to help people to take full advantage of the clothes they already own, allow them to make better shopping choices by mixing items from their wardrobe with items they want to buy. Seeing how specific item will work with existing items in the wardrobe as a whole will help users to avoid wasting money on repeat and spontaneous purchases and also reduce their environmental impact. Buying fewer things means more money in a pocket, and a little less pollution in the world.
